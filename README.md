Hi! I am Asif, I am currently learning python and I am also in the process of learning JavaScript, I am an ardent linux lover and I love the open source world.
I have always wanted to make my own contributions to the linux community! My aim is to create native linux applications with a sleek, minimal and modern UI. As of right now, for doing the "under the hood work", I am using python and bash.
But those won't remain my only options forever, as I am in the process of learning other languages, whilst making stuff and doing other fun things and messing around with other cool stuffs in general.
If u read it this far, thanks for having the patience of a saint to read my essay :p.
